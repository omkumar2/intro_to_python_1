# Find discounted price given price and discount_percent
# input variables : price: int, discount_percent: float
discounted_price = (1-discount_percent/100)*price # float

# Round the discounted_price
rounded_discounted_price = round(discounted_price) # int

# Find hrs and mins given the total_mins
# input variables : total_mins
hrs = total_mins//60 # int: hint: think about floor division operator
mins = total_mins%60 # int
